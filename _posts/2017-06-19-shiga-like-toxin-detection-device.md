      <p>Shiga-like Toxin Detection Device</p>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>In many developing countries, rapid urbanization leaves people with limited access to cooking facilities, resulting in a large dependence on reasonably priced and conveniently available street foods. These foods, however, pose a high risk of food poisoning due to microbial contamination. Lack of action taken by governments and street food vendors in developing countries lead to the prevalence of street food-related illnesses, and call for the necessity of consumer awareness. The project ultimately aims for a consumer-focused mechanism to detect Shiga-like toxins in foods. The device works based on detection of binding between the active receptor and a toxin.
