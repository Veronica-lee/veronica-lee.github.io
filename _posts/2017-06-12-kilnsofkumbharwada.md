              <center>Kilns of Kumbharwada is a collaborative design project with the goal of produing cost-effective and practical approaches to managing air pollution resulting from firing kilns and reducing a communityâ€™s exposure to noxious fumes.
      An experimental chimney has been designed and built in conjuction with experts from Kumbharwada, facilitators from urbz, and students from NYU Abu Dhabi. The design helps reduce local exposure to smoke. With the addition of wet scrubbing system, there is a possibility to filter particulate matter from the released smoke and potentially further lower the level of pollution released in the broader area.</center>
